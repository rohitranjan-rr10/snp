# SNP

SNP, short for Store and Purchase, represents a transformative project developed exclusively for the esteemed Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna. Prior to this initiative, the management of store and purchase records at our college relied heavily on MS Excel, leading to inefficiencies and complexities.

Through this groundbreaking project, we have revolutionized the way store and purchase operations are conducted. Our platform offers a unified solution, enabling seamless management and optimization of all processes related to store inventory and procurement activities.

By centralizing these operations within a sophisticated and tailor-made platform, we have significantly enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and overall workflow management. SNP represents a leap forward in modernizing administrative functions, empowering institutions like IIT Patna to excel in their operational excellence.
